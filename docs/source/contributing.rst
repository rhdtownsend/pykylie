Code
====

To contribute code to the PyKYLIE project, from bug fixes through to
major new features, the preferred method is the standard
fork---branch---pull-request paradigm described `here
<https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project>`__. If
your pull request languishes for more than a couple of weeks without
receiving a response, consider :git:`opening an issue
<rhdtownsend/pykylie/issues>` to give the developers a nudge.

Documentation
=============

To contribute documentation toward the project, follow the same
approach as above for code. (The ReStructured Text source files for
the documentation reside in the :file:`docs/source` subdirectory.)
